"57",1.3,"What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?","Abstraction and reusability.","Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug. Good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code. ALso allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism.",4,5,4.5,1.32268055428173,25
"58",1.3,"What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?","Abstraction and reusability.","This type of programming is more flexible, making it easier to add and modify the program.  It is also a type of a fail safe program, you check each individual module.  This eliminates redundant code and makes the program easier to read for other programmers.  When debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program.",5,5,5,0.990733171114015,18.5

The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding.  Post-programming maintenance is also easier.  Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.   Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.

The function prototype, by common practice is placed at the beginning of the program after the #includes and before main( ). The FUNCTION DEFINITION is the guts of the function. This is where the programmer decides what the function is going to do and tells it how to do it. It takes whatever information it is given and performs the operations. It works sort of like the brain, the brain takes in input and based upon that input performs in some way producing an output.

One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written ""+ a b"".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.
